# DataStorage 

## CRUD for Humans

The DataStorage project aims to allow the performing of CRUD operations
against **any** storage system: REST services, databases, etc., using a
standard, simple interface.

All projects conform to NetStandard 2.0 and are currently under heavy
development. They are probably not ready for production use.

Existing, concrete implementations:

- A MongoDB driver: `MongoDBDatabaseRepository`
- A WebApi REST client: `WebApiRestRepository`
